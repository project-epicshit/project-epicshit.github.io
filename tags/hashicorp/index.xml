Although Ansible comes also with a vault, but I decided to use Hashicorp Vault today.
The advantage of Hashicorp Vault is that you have a central management of credentials. The credential store can also be designed redundantly. The installation is easy and very fast.
All actions described here can also be done via WebUI.</description></item></channel></rss>
