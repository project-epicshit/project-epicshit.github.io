### Astra Control Center - December Release 2021
Today NetApp released the new release of Astra Control Center. ACC provides the ability to backup and restore kubernetes applications.

Besides the classic bugfixing there are now a few new features:

âœ… In-place restore

âœ… Execution hook

âœ… Support for additional Kubernetes distributions

I have summarized how the first two features work in a video.
