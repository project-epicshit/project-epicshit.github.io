ACC provides the ability to backup and restore kubernetes applications.
Besides the classic bugfixing there are now a few new features:
âœ… In-place restore
âœ… Execution hook
âœ… Support for additional Kubernetes distributions
I have summarized how the first two features work in a video.
The video is available in German for now.</description></item><item><title>Backup and Restore with NetApp</title><link>https://project.epicshit.io/blog/2021/08/12/netappacsbackupandrestore/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 06:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://project.epicshit.io/blog/2021/08/12/netappacsbackupandrestore/</guid><description>Astra Control Service View month ago, NetApp announced Astra Control Service as their application aware backup tool for cloud provider native kubernetes cluster. In my video I show you how the backup and restore will work on GCP or Azure.
