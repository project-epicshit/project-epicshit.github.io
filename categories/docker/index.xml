In the last days I had some time to continue development on my installer. Time to change: my first version based on a bash script which runs in extra docker container. For running the script it was required to mount the kubeconfig file into the docker container.
Now the architecture of the installer changed to a single manifest which includes all required parts.</description></item><item><title>Automated install of NetApp Trident using kubectl</title><link>https://hungry-carson-5114f7.netlify.app/blog/2020/09/10/tridentautomatedinstall/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Sep 2020 07:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://hungry-carson-5114f7.netlify.app/blog/2020/09/10/tridentautomatedinstall/</guid><description>Who wasnâ€˜t yet faced the challenge to install NetApp Trident on multiple kubernetes clusters? NetApp provides very good documentation on ReadTheDocs. But you must execute the instruction step by step.
In addition to this documentation, I would like to introduce a way to install trident automatically in any k8s cluster via kubectl.
The following yaml file can be used for this:
--- apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: k8s-trident-installer labels: app: trident-installer spec: containers: - name: installer image: fabianborn/k8s-trident-installer:latest ports: - containerPort: 19811 volumeMounts: - name: kconfig mountPath: &amp;#34;/config&amp;#34; subPath: kubeconfig env: - name: DEBUG value: &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; volumes: - name: kconfig configMap: name: trident-install-kubeconfig In preparation, the yaml file subPath: kubeconfig must be adapted to the original kubeconfig name.</description></item></channel></rss>
